Installation
============

At the moment, the library doesn't provide any CMake exports or `Find*.cmake`.
One can use the library by placing `include_subdirectory(mdk)`, which adds a
library target `mdk`. For reference, one can also take a look at the reference
`CMakeLists.txt` file in the project root.
