The functions that are absolutely crucial for the first prototype have (+) on the left.
Evalcpot has '+?', because it is used, but probably just a small fraction of it influences the result
(just repulsive interactions maybe?).

SIMULATION:
+	prepare			Simple	A function called before each step. Zeroes a lot of variables
					and recalculates many auxilary variables, like 'v' or 'vxv'.
+	update_verlet_list	Hard	Updates the verlet list, but it's hard to say
					what actually is updated there.
+	evalgo			Hard	Computes the energy and force of the Go model.
					The interactions include:
					    - harmonic between residues i and i + 1
					    - standard L-J between native contacts
					    - repulsive L-J between residues i and i + 2
					    - repulsive L-J between residues that aren't in
					      a native contact but are close to each other.
					    - some weird stuff with ss bonds.
+?	evalcpot 		Hard	Calculates energy and force of the custom potential (???)
+	evalangles 		Medium  Computes the energy and force related
					to bond (i-1, i, i+1) and dihedral (i-2, i-1, i, i+1) angles.
	evalimproper 		Medium	Calculates energy and force of the PID potential.
	evalwall		Medium	Computes the energy and forces related to wall interactions.

	afm			Simple	Applies constant AFM force on the first and last residue.
	vafm 			Medium	Applies AFM force on the first and last residue by simulating
					a harmonic spring that moves with constant velocity.

+	corr			VSimple Corrector step from the predictor-corrector method.

+	lang			VSimple	Adds langevin noise and damping
					(which simulates the effect of implicit solvent).

					order by their lengths.

INPUT:  Every function here is called at most once and before the main loop starts.

	load_allatom		Simple	Part of 'compute_contact_map'. Given the PDB file, it reads
					the native positions of atoms in the protein.
+	load_protein 		Hard 	Loads the native conformation and SS bonds from the PDB file. 
					Big part of it runs only when 'lunwrap' is true
					(unwrapping coordinates arising from periodic boundary conditions).
	load_cmap		VSimple	Loads native contacts directly from a .map file (also dihedral
					and bond angles).
	load_sequence		Simple	Loads sequences of amino acids to simulate (for disordered proteins),
					also loads contact maps specified in the 'seqfile'.
	load_paramfile		Simple	Loads various parameters from 'paramfile' (example3 has 'parameters.txt').

+	compute_native_angles	VSimple Computes dihedral and bond angles for native conformation.
+	gopotential 		Simple 	If 'lpdb' is true, it calculates the sigmas of L-J potential
					for all contacts (the meaning of sigmas - p. 9 in the paper).
	model_chirality 	VSimple	Calculates the chiralities for the native structure.
	amino_acid_mass		VSimple Computes masses of residues relative to the mass
					of the entire protein. 		

	compute_contact_map 	Medium 	Computes native contacts from a PDB file based on the positions
					of individual atoms in the amino-acids.
+	compute_cmap 		Simple  Simpler alternative to 'compute_contact_map'. It defines a contact
					between residues by the cut-off on the distance between C-alpha atoms.
	assign_VdW_radius 	Medium 	Part of 'compute_contact_map'. It assigns the Van der Waals radius
					to all atoms in the amino-acids in the chains. Also performs some
					checks.

	displace 		Simple  Displaces one specified pair of chains away from each other
					by a given distance.
+	confstart 		Medium	Generates the starting conformation (it's supposed to be
					a self-avoiding random walk).
+	intvel3d 		Simple	Assigns initial velocities to the pseudoatoms.

STATISTICS:
+	gyration		VSimple	Computes radius of gyration of the protein, which is the
					standard deviation of distances from residues to the center of mass.

	cgyration		Medium	Computes various statistics - the radii of gyration for all chains,
					also W (asphericity parameter, whatever that is). Also finds knots.
	kmt			Hard	Used only in 'cgyration'. Finds the beginning and end of a knot
					in a chain. Possibly some knot theory is needed to understand it.

	kabsch			Medium	Given two sequences of 3D vectors of equal length, finds a rotation
					+ translation that minimizes the root mean sqared deviation between
					them. See 'Kabsch algorithm' on Wikipedia.
	compute_rmsd		VSimple	Calls 'kabsch' on the positions of residues after simulation ends
					and their original positions.

OUTPUT:
	print_restart		VSimple	Prints the restart file.
	print_conformation	Medium	Prints the conformation in the PDB format.	
	print_conf_xyz		VSimple Prints the conformation in the XYZ format.
	print_cmap		VSimple	If 'lwritego' is true, no simulations are performed and this
					function prints the contact map.
	print_map		Medium	Prints a contact map file that contains all the contacts after
					the simulation (optionally adds some details about angles).
	compute_details		Simple	Given two residues, computes some angles between them.
					Used in 'print_map' when 'ldet' is true.

	connect_to_wal_one_by_o	???	???
	connect_to_wal		???	???
	make_fcc		Simple	Creates a 2-layer, triangular lattice of beads that form a wall.

OTHER:
	sort/sort2		VSimple	Just a quicksort (sort2 applies the same permutation to
					a second array).
	angeval			Medium	Never called. Maybe the older version of evalangles.
	compute_ssbonds		Simple	Never called. Probably obsolete.

	build_titin 		Simple 	Used for building titin - a very large protein composed
					of many protein domains.
	interdomain 		Simple	Next step for building titin, disables contacts between
					different domains of titin.
